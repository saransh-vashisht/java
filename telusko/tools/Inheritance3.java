public class Inheritance3 extends Inheritance2 { // used to do the inheritance 

    // inheritance 3 is the sub class and the inheritance 2 is the superclass and to inherit we use the keyword of the extends.
    public int multi(int n1,int n2){
        return n1*n2;

}
// to make the two function of inheritance 2 work we can have the same functions here to make it work but by copying it will create the redundancy of the code to avoid this the inheritance is done

// we can inherit even if we do not have the java file and still have the class file bcz the java helps us in inheriting it by from the compiled class files.
